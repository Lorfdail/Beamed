# Beamed.ResourceGenerator

## What

This will be used as a CLI tool to scrap Mixer's docs and generate C#
code from it. Not quite ready yet.

## Why

Mixer's API defines a *lot* of entities. See https://dev.mixer.com/rest.html.
This tool could make the workflow faster.

## Note

This tool might be removed *really soon* in the future.
